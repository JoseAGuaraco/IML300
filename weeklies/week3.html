    <p><b>How is Owen's work related to the internet?</b><br>Laura Owen’s work is very similar to assemblage, in that a lot of her work is a combination of objects and textures, with some protruding out of the frame. Some of the paintings I saw at the Geffen had pain laid on extremely thick, that some of it was protruding off the canvas. Another painting, for example, had a cutout of an illustration of a bird, and the wing was off the canvas. Much like internet art (like memes) are a combination of different things, Laura Owens’s work combined newspaper clippings, with her own illustrations, with textured freehand lines. She would add an element of depth by painting drop shadows around the illustrations and lines.
	Her work also relates to the internet in that some of it seemed to be very grid based. In some paintings, she incorporated pixel-based art and textures. Some of my favorite ways that she incorporated pixels is through pixel-based halftone patterns to imitate smooth gradients. In a different painting near the entrance to the gallery had four pixel-based birds, and one of them was on a motor that rotated. Some art had illustrations that were clearly in her style, but pixel-based rather than hand-drawn.</p>
