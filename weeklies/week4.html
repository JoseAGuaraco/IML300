    <p><b><i>In Defense of the Poor Image</i> by Hito Steyerl</b><br>“In Defense of the Poor Image,” a chapter in Hito Steyerl’s book <i>The Wretched of the Screen</i>, defends the “poor image.” She uses this label to describe low-resolution imagery, and imperfect visual art. Imperfections, she says, are so reviled in multimedia that Woody Allen turned out-of-focus imagery into a disease plaguing and actor in <i>Deconstructing Harry</i>. Hollywood has grown so large that people’s ideas of films have changed, and now they must all be spectacular, with shots perfectly in focus, in frame, and in high resolution. Indie filmmaking has fallen to the wayside as a result. I completely agree with her defense of the “poor image.” After all, art is the way through which people communicate their humanity—their hopes, dreams, fears, everything. Humans are imperfect, and if traditional art can have mistakes and imperfections, so can digital art. Furthermore, Steyerl details what the poor image represents int eh 21st century. “The poor image is no longer about the real thing … it is about … swarm circulation, digital dispersion … defiance and appropriation,” she writes. To me, this is explanatory of the internet, and how culture is exported through it. Old films and pieces of culture will live on forever on the internet, often as memes that are shared over and over again. Memes are almost a new form of communication, a way through which people on the internet can express their views on current events and culture, often humorously. Of course, this sharing and re-sharing results in resolution loss, and not everyone has perfect editing skills, so memes are the prime example of imperfect Photoshopping, video editing, illustrating, you name it. The poor image, as much as it is eschewed in favor of professional art, has a lot of worth. It should be embraced for its power to bring art—and its unique way to communicate the human experience—to the masses.
