    <p><b>The Xenofeminist Manifesto</b><br>
	The Xenofeminist manifesto is certainly one of the more complex and dense texts that I have read in a while. It seems to be an extrapolation of current trends in the feminist and LGBT community, where gender roles are being abolished. One problem I see with Xenofeminism is the goal of using technological advancement and policy for the greater benefit of humankind. Achieving this goal would mean finding a way for large technology corporations and governments to stop caring selfishly about their own enrichment, and using their power to benefit other people. This, more or less, goes against their capitalistic goals. A solution to this would be, then, to abolish capitalism. However, it is through capitalism that people can become specialized, knowledgeable, and wealthy enough for any advancement to go on. If the goal of Xenofeminism is to develop ways to free humanity from natural and gender-based limits, how is this supposed to be accomplished without money. Who will fund the necessary technological, and medical research? I feel like Xenofeminism falls into similar pitfalls as general communism. No one would be willing to put in the immense amount of work required to advance humanity merely for the “greater good” and without compensation. Another aspect that I felt was worth exploring is the fact that the Xenofeminism manifesto aims to create a world where there are millions, even infinite numbers of genders. I wonder what is the purpose behind over-complicating the concept of identity by keeping the concept of a “gender” alive. If Xenofeminism really wants to abolish gender roles, they should do away with the concept of gender in its entirety. Rather than having individuals say, “I’m a <i>woman</i>” or “I’m a <i>man</i>,” they could simply be saying, “I’m <i>me</i>.” Individuals could simply identify as themselves, rather than continue using obsolete terms like “man/woman” or “male/female.” I imagine that creating all kinds of new genders would also entail creating matching pronouns, rendering language and communication more complicated, and social interactions a veritable minefield of offense and misgendering. The best solution would be instead to adapt the English language so that the use of “they” as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun becomes normalized. Alternatively, a new pronoun could be created, to serve that purpose. </p>
