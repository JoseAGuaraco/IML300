    <p><b>How does this text relate to Foucault’s ideas on control?</b><br>
	“Postscript on the Societies of Control” brings up Foucault to expand upon his ideas of control. Deleuze argues that the way in which capitalism controls society has changed drastically between the 19th century and the modern day. Deleuze writes that “Individuals have become ‘dividuals,’ and masses, samples, data, markets, or ‘banks.’ This is in tune with the modern idea of a “Panopticon.” The new people in power are no longer factory owners and rich individual capitalists as they were in the 19th century. Now, the people in power are corporations. Now, corporations aren’t literally people, but Deleuze knows that they are often treated as such. He writes, “We are taught that corporations have a soul, which is the most terrifying news in the world.” Terrifying because this treatment of them as people makes them far richer and more powerful “individuals” than any factory owner in the 1800s could possibly be. Not only that, the reach of modern corporations is international, meaning that the people in power can rule over a massive portion of the world population. Because of this shift in power, regular people—you and me—have become “dividuals,” divisions of data samples and markets. The people in power get to define what the common people are, and corporations use us as data so that they know what to sell us, and how to advertise it to us. This constant monitoring of data by advertisers is the essence of the new type of Panopticon. It’s similar to the data surveillance that some governments are currently doing, but this time it’s by corporations. This is in order for them to get richer and richer, control our tastes and wants, and remain in power.
