    <p><b>How is the work of Pierre Huyghe relational/systemic?</b><br>
	The work of Pierre Huyghe I read the work of Pierre Huyghe as both relational and systemic. Overall, the art seems to be about the interplay between human environments and nature. Many of his installations include human elements within a natural space, or the converse. The relational aspect of his work stems from the fact that his art is not isolated from the rooms and galleries in which it’s installed, but relates to it. For example, he maintains the appearance of the MET’s rooftop garden, but alters it by ripping up the floor and installing a custom aquarium. He also maintains the appearance of a disused ice rink in Münster, and embraces the design of the Sydney Opera House when creating a living arboretum inside of it. This aspect continues, in that his installations are pieces that people can walk through and explore, interacting with the art. The systems aspect of the art is even more apparent, as in “After ALife Ahead” in the Münster ice rink. Huyghe combines both artificial intelligence, and nature to create a living ecosystem. These two systems work together, and both systems affect each other. Primarily, the AI helps the bacteria in the natural ecosystem grow; however, the natural ecosystem includes birds as well. The Sydney Opera House is also a very clear system, where he created a living arboretum. The plants and trees even caused enough perspiration for the Opera house to become completely fogged up. This shows that Huyghe wants to create living ecosystems, not just for the sake of aesthetics, but for the sake of keeping them alive and thriving. When discussing the installation he created on the rooftop of the Met in New York City, he stated that he was interested in creating living natural ecosystem with varied ranges of organisms, and seeing how they developed within the artificial ecosystem he built.
