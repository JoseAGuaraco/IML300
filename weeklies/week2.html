    <p>How was the internet shaped by Objectivism? <br> Objectivism is a philosophy developed by Russian-American author Ayn Rand. It’s core tenets state that human beings have no responsibility to be altruistic or selfless, and that people should be focused mainly on their own personal happiness. American economist Alan Greenspan believed that technology and computers would become advanced enough that the people running private corporations could behave according to Objectivism, and computer networks would regulate and control the market. In practice, this didn’t work out. However I believe that objectivism has affected the internet, both by having people adhere to it, and rejected. It seems that mainly large corporations are the ones that adhere to Objectivism. For instance, the way in which social media networks, specifically Facebook, have a lax approach to consumer privacy is one such case of Objectivism being put into practice. The site has been known to sell personal information to advertisers and data companies for profit. Facebook also puts little effort into curtailing misinformation on its site. This lack of regulation is similar to laissez-faire capitalism (an economic philosophy very in line with Objectivism). With this in mind, the internet has been widely used for charitable reasons. Jimmy Wales founded Wikipedia with the intention of providing free information to everybody. The website has since become one of the largest catalogues of information in the world. People can freely edit the site with no expectation of compensation, and despite its negative reputation, the information on the site has a startling degree of accuracy. Social media itself has also been used to begin activism, with Twitter campaigns having real-world consequences. It’s normally regular people who use the Internet for more selfless reasons, and they can boycott corporations that refuse to behave as such.</p>
