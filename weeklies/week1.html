    <p><b>What is the relationship between diagrams and meaning?</b><br>American philosopher C.S. Peirce describes diagrams as "moving pictures of thought." This description highlights how diagrams can serve as images that visually represent connections between ideas. Human thought is not much different, as our thinking is essentially creating connections between abstract concepts that can be used in the real world. When speaking, for instance, we connect our abstract ideas to groupings of letters that we connect together to form words which we connect to sounds which we then speak out. As complex as that sentence was to write, it's the simplest description of thought that I can come up with. This ability to visualize is what makes diagrams so invaluable to complex thought. They can help visualize connections that could be easily made in the mind, but cannot be completely remembered. Flowcharts display causal links between events, Venn diagrams display similarities and differences between concepts and ideas, and so on. This is how diagrams can display meaning and the relationship between meaning. Diagrams are so adept at this, that they can be used for science, mathematics, art, and humor. XKCD famously makes comics about science and humor, and many of his pieces involve diagrams displaying humorous connections between ideas. After all, humor is based on connections between ideas that make no sense, are paradoxical, or are absurd. They can therefore be displayed as diagrams as well.
