    <p><b>Do you agree with Lyotards position on gender?</b><br>
      I agree with Lyotards position on gender, to the extent that it is a construct humans created as a result of sexual dimorphism in humans. Sexual reproduction is predicated on the female and male sex each having parts that the other does not. They complement each other through sexual intercouse in such a way that children can be conceived. So that's what sex is, coolio. Anyway, if thought were to go on without a body, it would only be a matter of time until these concepts of gender and sexual difference are undone. If thought were to go on without a body, there would be no need for reproduction, as thought would essentially be eternal. But that is a digression. Much like in Xenofeminism, if all differences between sexes were to be eliminated, then (heterosexual) attraction would no longer be predicated on the desire to reproduce, and all sexual/emotional attraction may just be based on the desire for companionship or similar emotions. Lyotard also shows that the social construct of gender is unecessary. While sex is based on physical, biological differences, gender merely serves to dictate what people can do, and how. In my opinion, it's unecessary, and only serves to hold people back. It extends from large scale effects like femicide in some parts of the world, to men being unable to take up knitting as a hobby for fear of being seen as "girly" by their peers. In an ideal world without gender, knitting, for instance, wouldn't be seen as "girly." "Girly" wouldn't even exist. Knitting would merely be knitting. Playing football would merely be football. People would be able to do whatever they please, and women, especially, would not be subjugated as they are now in all parts of the world.
