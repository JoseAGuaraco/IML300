    <p><b>How does the Panopticon play out in our contemporary lives?</b><br>
	<i>Philosophize This</i> mentions one interesting way in which the Panopticon plays out in everyday life. This is at work. The narrator says, “Surveillance by way of cameras, time clocks, supervisors, deadlines, monitoring activity on your computer, even sometimes just the surveillance of other employees around that feel like they benefit from having dirt on someone in a highly competitive environment.” Specifically in offices, employees are always being watched, and the results of this surveillance will come in as performance reviews. However, there’s a more recent, more obvious type of Panopticon in our everyday lives: government surveillance. Ever since Edward Snowden blew the whistle on the National Security Agency’s mass surveillance operations on American citizens, people have been exceedingly aware of how they are being tracked. Nobody has any idea when their online activity, or phone calls and text messages are being read, but there is evidence that shows that it has happened. More so, government agencies have pushed companies like Apple to unencrypted and unlock smartphones for them to search. Yet the extent of surveillance in the US isn’t as insane as it is in other countries. Take China. The Chinese government has rolled out a type of credit score system on steroids. Now, people’s online information is being tracked by the Chinese government, and used to rate citizens. People will be rated based on how early they pay bills and rent, if they have any outstanding debt, if they get driving or parking tickets, among several other things. Even being in contact with other people who have such problems will bring one’s own score down. One thing that helps the Chinese government with this type of mass surveillance is that many Chinese residents use an app called WeChat. WeChat is China’s answer to WhatsApp, Facebook, Venmo, and so many other platforms. People can schedule hair appointments, order food, get a taxi, and pay back friends all in the same instant messaging app. Having all of this information in one place like WeChat allows the government to easily access this type of information from the company. A week ago I stumbled upon a Bloomberg Businessweek video on YouTube called “Inside China's High-Tech Dystopia”. It details what life is like in the high-tech city of Shenzhen. At one point, the video’s presenter interviews a group of foreign tech and computer engineers working in Shenzhen. One of them tells an anecdote of him jaywalking across a street. Only <i>seconds</i> later, he receives a police citation to his WeChat. He was fined, and the money was automatically taken from his bank account connected to the app. He didn’t even authorize the charge. Hopefully, this insane style of Panopticon will never reach other parts of the world, but this is certainly the reality that some people are currently living in.
