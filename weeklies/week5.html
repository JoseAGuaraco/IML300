    <p><b>Do you think humans can be understood through cybernetics?</b><br>	Based on the episode, I think humans can definitely not be understood through cybernetics. Cybernetics was found to be completely inapplicable to nature in general. Nature, it turns out, is not a self-regulating, perfectly balanced system. For example, the populations of wolves and elks has varied widely through centuries, and computer models created using the most accurate data possible showed that this system could not be balanced and regulated. Humans are in this Earth, and are pretty much still a part of nature. Nature’s rules still govern us, and our behavior to some degree. In the episode, the hippie groups that formed from the belief that nature was a perfect system were short lived. According to Adam Curtis, “strong personalities came to dominate the weaker members of the group, but the rules of the self-organizing system refused to allow any organized opposition to this oppression.” This meant that the more powerful, more aggressive people naturally began to create a hierarchical system in the communes. Comparing this to the predator-prey relationships mentioned in the episode, it makes sense. The predators naturally come to dominate the prey. I’m not equating humans with wolves, but I think that in nature, and in humanity, a hierarchical system organically was created. The cybernetic system allowed every person to have a voice, but it doesn’t account for the fact that all humans are wildly different. It also doesn’t take into account that humans aren’t as perfectly logical as numbers and math. Humans also act based on emotions, which seem pretty illogical most of the time. </p>
